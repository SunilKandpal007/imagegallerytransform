Responsive image gallery using CSS grid and transform property.
To make responsive Image Gallery, I have used CSS grid property, **Grid** is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns. Grid is part of the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) specification and is designed to make it easier to design and manage the layout of web pages or web applications. And the **transform** property is used to apply various two-dimensional and three-dimensional transformations to elements on a web page. These transformations can include translations, rotations, scaling, and skewing, allowing you to manipulate the position and appearance of elements without affecting the layout of the document. The transform property is particularly useful for creating animations and achieving visually appealing effects on web pages. Rotation functions allow you to rotate an element. For example, to rotate an element by 45 degrees, you can use: **Example** .img-1{transform: rotate(45deg);} //
